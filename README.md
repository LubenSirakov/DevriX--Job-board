# DevriX-Job-board

//Introduction and an overview
This is a repository for a simple job board project listing website similar to jobs.bg
The project has a landing page listing all jobs, simple admin area for editing jobs submissions.

//Requirements
For this project, I used PHP and created a simple database for having the job offers using MySQL.
This simple PHP project has the following functionality:
  A simple Job board page listing all job offers
  A submission form providing the option to submit a new job offer
  A dashboard page for administrators to be able to see all jobs submissions, being able to edit and delete entries
  
//Front-end Views  
In regards to the front-end views, I used the resources specifically prepared for me which can be found here:
Code: https://github.com/xavortm/html-template-jobs/tree/main
This is how the front-end should look like: https://html-template-jobs.vercel.app/

//End Result

A single offer has:
  Title
  Description

-Having a simple administrative panel listing job offers and being able to delete and edit offers
-Having a README.md file in the Git repository explaining the required setup for the project and short information about the project
-An export of your final database for reviewing the structure and the data

//Bonus points

-Having an option to search by a keyword for jobs - DONE
-Having a paginated listing page, being able to go to page 2, page 3, etc
